# Queue data structure app

This is a queue data structure app done a course called Databases and data structures at Business College Helsinki in December 2023. You can add green, orange and red wagons and remove them. The added wagon is put after the recently added wagon. When you remove, you remove the wagon that has been the longest time in the queue. The purpose of the task is to demonstrate the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) principle.
